# Demo of this application

Below is a demo for this React Application. This app displays 508 Missouri Public schools on the home page. Each box next to a school represents an administrative contact for that school. The color of the boxes represent the following: 
- White: I have not emailed them.
- Red: I have emailed them but they have not responded.
- Green: I have emailed them and they have responded.

When a school name is clicked, a new page is opened that shows each contact. The appearance of the contact card is explained by the following:
- White Email Button: I have not emailed them yet.
- Red "X" Button: I have emailed them but they have not replied.
- Green Checkmark Button: I have emailed them and they have replied.
