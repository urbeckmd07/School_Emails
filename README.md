# Demo of this application

Below is a demo for this React Application. This app displays 508 Missouri Public schools on the home page. Each box next to a school represents an administrative contact for that school. The color of the boxes represent the following: 
- White: I have not emailed them.
- Green: I have emailed them .

When a school name is clicked, a new page is opened that shows each contact. Contacts that have not been emailed are white while contacts that have been emailed are grayed out. When the email icon is clicked, an email draft is opened with the contact's email address filled into the "To:" section. This was opened on my other monitor so it was not captured in this demo.
